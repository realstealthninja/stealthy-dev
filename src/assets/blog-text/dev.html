  why not?. Stealthy dev is a place for me to share ideas
  write about things. showcase my projects ect... it has to be one of the things
  that i am supposed to uphold. Ramblings like this one are way too common in my life it would be a waste if they are
  not preserved until the end of time
  I think writing is one of those passions that you never really think about. I love writing but i've never really
  talked about how I like writing.
  Something like this paragraph where ideas are freely expressed with no restrictions, no control no flow.
  there is flow of words but never consistent of topic or time. Maybe its somehow related to me not liking structure or
  even structure not liking me. But I like to think there is a definte structure in everything its just deeply hidden.
  and thats kinda beautiful if you think about it. The world with its mesmorizing patterns, Earth showing us the entire
  and total beauty of nature. I'd like to think there is beauty in even the most horrific aspects of nature.
  The ugly often is considered as very two dimentional when even the ugly is complex in its creation, life and death.
  Existance is a beautiful dance of fate and destiny ever spiraling into oblivion. Ever spirialing into unimaginable
  complexities ever growing,
  ever exapanding in its beauty. <br/><br/>
  Thinking more on why I made this website makes me realise how it has been in a constant cycle of ever inconsitent
  development patterns
  there are these days of intense developing and other of extreme procrastinations. But in the end this will never be
  complete by any means. to put the period at the end of a sentence, even when you dont want to contiue is hard.
  it often reminds me of how letting go is hard. It must be done according to some, There will always be pieces though.
  shattered incomplete parts that dont seem coheret or even to exist at all. It might or might not stand out but still,
  it is there. Ever looming the dark abysses of your heart. getting forgotten day by day minute by minute second by
  second, slowly erroding but never collapsing until one day you look back to see this flower ever so tiny yet so
  pretty. always pretty.
  I often wonder what the future holds, in reality it doesnt matter what the future holds. we are always marching
  towards it. resistance isnt futile but required.
  I blend life, passions, death and many other things in my daily wonderings if you were wondering. I think music has to
  be one of the greatest factors of my life. It really has a strong grip of society.
  the most popular songs determine what society is thinking about or what it thinks is the best sounding.

  Tangents aside, There isnt one clear answer to why i made this site. It is a multilayered three dimentional cake of
  sound and unsound reasoning.
  Its one of those things where you dont know why but at the same time know exactly why.
