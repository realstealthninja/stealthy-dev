    <h4>A grand old oak</h4>
<pre>
Unimaginative blurted the wise oak.
No where to look or to go... 
For this concrete jungle was it's home
polluted, noisy and broke.

This wise lion once king
who ruled these lands larger than ming.
Emperor of green, now with dead leaves.
Branches left clinging, now and then creaks.

Old and wise it's bark has only bites
From saws, mills, the plague or plight.
The veridian grove grayed from it's nooks.
Plastic waters of the brook

No more breaths left till grand roll.
oxygen adored in the poisionous fold
of carbon, root of life no more
the death duo becomes the folk lore

Lured to sleep, the grand oak felled.
the last bastion of mother nature with, dealt
conqured by inhumane things
it's grandiour in nature, rings
