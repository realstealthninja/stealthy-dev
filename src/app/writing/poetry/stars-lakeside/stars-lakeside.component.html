    <h4>stars lake side</h4>

<pre>
Looking at the waters I sat
sitting on a vast green mat
looking at me was the stars
For a moment I thought i was in mars.

The reed filled mat was pretty and large
Atop a tide I saw a barge
waiting for me to explore this big blue dish
sweet with the smell of roses lush

The waters showed me my mind.
It was clear, So clear infact 
that i could see my past,
even the future, yet remained now at last
