    <h4>A big bright star</h4>
    <pre>
A big bright star.
So close yet so far...
Spent eternity gazing the sky
Hoping for a hey or a good bye .

Outshining the night light
My head felt a little at height
thought forever meant a long time
Otherwise said the fading bright lime.

I hope with dusk it will rise
I hope i didn't strain it's eyes
With me staring at the night sky
Oh star, please just be fine
    </pre>
