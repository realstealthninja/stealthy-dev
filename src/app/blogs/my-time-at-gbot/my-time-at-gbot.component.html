        <h3>Robotics an art worth the money</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        Its quite interesting that i've never really considered robotics my whole life until the day i got the
        opportunity to do a workshop with the G-Bot team from <a href="https://www.gecwyd.ac.in/">Kalpetta Engineering
            college</a>.
        We were teamed based on our schools, So i was teamed with my class mate. I arrived early to setup our linux box
        and installed arduino IDE. Did I mention that we were working with <a
            href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduinos</a>&ThickSpace; <em> very exciting</em>.

            This lil tiny board can do so many cool things.
            point your attention to the Chip. That's a ATmega328P right there.

    We sat at the very back, and the workshop had began with bang. They introduced us to the arduino showing us how it
    worked and doing some basic things like lighting an onboard LED of the Arduino. The arduinos worked on variant of
    C++, i prefer to call it embeded C but that's probably <em> Very wrong</em>.
    There are 14 digital pins on an arduino board they output/input ones and zeros and 6 analog pins which input/output
    a range of values most likely from 0-1024 why? because the chip has processor for analog I/O operations which
    converts the physical electric signals into ones and zeros. Here is the code for lighting an LED
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code class="language-arduino">
/**
 * @brief Lights the LED with the given pin number
 */
void light_led(int num)&lcub;
  digitalWrite(num + 3, HIGH); 
  delay(num * 2000);
  digitalWrite(num + 3, LOW);
&rcub;
    </code>
